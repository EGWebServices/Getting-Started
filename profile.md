Edit Your Personal Profile
--------------------------

Your personal profile serves as your home on EduGuide.org, and your personal dashboard is a lot like your front door, where everyone lands when they want to communicate or send a friend request. So, it is important to make sure that your personal profile area--made up of your dashboard, goals page, and network--help to tell your story.

Editing your profile
You can make changes to your personal profile by clicking on the "My Settings" at the very top of the page and then "Edit Profile." You will be taken to the "Edit Your Profile" page, where you can make changes to the following:

 - Email address
 - Password Personal Notification settings
 - Personal Team Notification settings

There is a place for each section of the page where you can save your changes.
